**Definition of Uniform Continuity:**


We say $f$ is uniformly continuous on $S\in \R$ if for every $\epsilon >0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that if $m, n \in S$, 
and $$|m - n|< \delta$$ then: 
$$|f(m)-f(n)|<\epsilon$$

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gamesatosi/gamesatosi.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
